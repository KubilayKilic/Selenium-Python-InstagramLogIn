# Python Instagram Login
This script allows you to log in to your Instagram account without having to type in your username and password everytime.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* selenium
* browser webdriver

### Installing
Git clone the entire repository. You will only need the Instagramotologinselenium.py file.

### Executing Program
In the Instagramotologinselenium.py file, hardcode your username and password on lines 25 and 26, respectively. In your preferred IDE, execute the script
and see the magic happen.

### Notes
Please ensure that the version of your browser and the version of your selenium webdriver match otherwise the program will not work because the two cannot
communicate with each other. It is recommended you try Microsoft Edge with Edge's specific selenium webdriver.
